Ghost followers arent following their parent.

This is probably because somewhere in the code,
`ent.vel = X` is being done.
So when child ghosts look at the vector they were assigned, it is no longer
being mutated as they expect (which leaves children ghosts following a dead vector)

Only way to salvage this is to make a dumb behaviour tree update function unfortunetely :/
