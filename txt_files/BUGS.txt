ORIGIN OF THE BUG AND SOLUTION:
pretty much all MoveBehaviour Systems use `ent.behaviour.move.target` as a vec3 value.
LOCKON, however, uses `.target` as a `Entity` type to track ents. We can fix this
by changing `target` to a vec3 quantity, and allocating an extra field to store
the entity. (This way we can use `cexists(ent)` to check whether the ent that is
being followed still exists.)

FOR FUTURE TODO ::::
DOCUMENT THE MoveBehaviourSys FIELDS WAYYYY BETTER!!!! BE MORE RIGOUROUS, and be
consistent. Ensure to do background checks on data passed into each moveBehaviour,
and just be super rigorous when switching moveBehaviours.
(Add a tonne of assertions into ccall("setMoveBehaviour", ... ) )
