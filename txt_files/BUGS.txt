Task strings not being added correctly.
I am pretty (99% sure) this is to do with behaviourTree's
Task module

SOURCE OF BUG DISCOVERED!!!!  (I think, double check this)
For some reason, the Node and Task objects are being deleted from PROXY
whenever they are used as a string in another Node object.
