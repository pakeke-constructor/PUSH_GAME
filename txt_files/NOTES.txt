Don't forget the give the player feedback

For example, when attempting to push an entity and failing,
Give feedback with particles and sound.


colours =>
{
    0 0 0   Black/outline
    0 0 1   Special item colour (coin, shop, artefact)
    0 1 0   Grass green
    0 1 1   Dark green
    1 0 0   Enemy/damage colour
    1 0 1   Dark Enemy/damage colour
    1 1 0   Grey
    1 1 1   White (player colour)
}


WHYYYY DOESN'T LUA ALLOW SHARED MEMORY BETWEEN LUA STATES!!!


Make a giant worm enemy.
How should this be accomplished?
Probably Via a `follow` component that enables an entity to follow directly behind another ent.

You could also add different types of follow, i.e. "behind" follow type, for the Giant worm nodes, 
or "orbit" follow type, like the orbitals in binding of isaac.
A radius parameter is also probably a good idea when implementing this system as well.
