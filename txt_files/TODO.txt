Make guys headband more thick, also add a tiny bit of shading
(Also try putting black outlines around it, see how that looks)



remove addVel() and setVel() events, and simply change the entity velocities normally.
( to find all the Cyan.call("setVel") calls, raise an error from all a system that uses it )



Plan a way to structure behavioural state and animation state for entities
(probably use finite state machine, with behavioural tree as component, pointing to funcs)



Extend MoveBehaviourSys to allow for more customizable parameters
(most importantly:  sight distance)   (Alternatively, you could just
enable the other behavioural systems to change the behaviour-movestate at will.)





Perhaps add an autotarget to physics objects upon player induced :boom(),
so projectiles are more likely to hit enemies. (Also increase max speed, add camera:shake() )



For GenerationSys:
Instead of deleting walls that are not relevant, mark them as "psuedo walls".
psuedo walls are still drawn, but are not assigned a physics body.
This way the walls will still look nice but will not induce overhead.
--- IDEA !! Maybe you could also draw them differently since they are deeper in?
