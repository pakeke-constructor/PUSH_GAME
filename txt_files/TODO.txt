Check ParticleSys for memory leaks!!!
(Best way to do this -> check that no excess ParticleSyses are being
created when not neccessary)



Rework followSys (see note at top of file)



Make guys headband more thick, also add a tiny bit of shading
(Also try putting black outlines around it, see how that looks)


automatically set ent components to nil upon being removed from systems
(as in, each system is responsible for their respective components!
MoveSys is responsible for removing .pos and .vel, DrawSys is responsible for removing .draw,
BobbingSys is responsible for removing .bobbing, etc etc.)
This will remove a LOT of pressure on GC.
(especially upon ccall("purge") events.)


Tiny blob ent (drops 1 token)

Big blob ent  
-   can break walls
-   splits into regular blobs, except the regular blobs split into 3 or 4 Tiny blobs
        - (regular blobs shouldnt do that)
        -  This regular blob variant also shouldnt drop any tokens, as the tiny blob
                ents that it splits into will drop plenty.
