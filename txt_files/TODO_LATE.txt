Perhaps add an autotarget to physics objects upon player induced :boom(),
so projectiles are more likely to hit enemies. (Also increase max speed, add camera:shake() )





Extend MoveBehaviourSys to allow for more customizable parameters
(most importantly:  sight distance)   (Alternatively, you could just
enable the other behavioural systems to change the behaviour-movestate at will.)
