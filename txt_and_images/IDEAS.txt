Don't forget the give the player feedback

For example, when attempting to push an entity and failing,
Give feedback with particles and sound.





Add a chest that, when destroyed, gives gold coins.
Make it so coins act like tokens maybe?




Slime bossfight explosions should damage player.
Use `ccall("apply")` for this probably 



add smoke during explosions



For `bigwall` entity, make it so if the player
emits a boom next to them, they die and spawn 8-9 physics blocks.
