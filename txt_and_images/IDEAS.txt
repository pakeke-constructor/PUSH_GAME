Don't forget the give the player feedback

For example, when attempting to push an entity and failing,
Give feedback with particles and sound.


Make a giant worm enemy.
How should this be accomplished?
Probably Via a `follow` component that enables an entity to follow directly behind another ent.

You could also add different types of follow, i.e. "behind" follow type, for the Giant worm nodes, 
or "orbit" follow type, like the orbitals in binding of isaac.
A radius parameter is also probably a good idea when implementing this system as well.




Slime bossfight explosions should damage player.
Use `ccall("apply")` for this probably 




For `bigwall` entity, make it so if the player
emits a boom next to them, they die and spawn 8-9 physics blocks.




Lewis Idea:
An entity which carries a shield (physics object) in front of it.
The player must run behind it and hit it from behind to damage it
