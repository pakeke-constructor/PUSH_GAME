==============
Dont know where its from,
but it happened near when a `mallow` entity was killed

shitttt.. This bug is scuffed as all heck man. Its probably been there for months.
My suspicion is that its a very edge-case scenario... quick look over the LASys told me
that nil index for .tracking is "impossible", as only nil scenario is when anim_base runs
:finish(), and there is (definitely) a branch check for that.
Come back to this w/ clear mind

Oh no, there has been an Error.
If you can, please contact Oli and show a full screenshot of this error screen. TY!

Entities can walk through walls again. NICE!
Do more research in how physics objects can be temporarily suspended whilst keeping
their physical properties (primarily, velocity) intact and cached correctly.
There will probably be a box2d function for it. Ask of the love2d discord if need be
