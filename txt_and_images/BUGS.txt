Entities are dying offscreen for an unknown reason
ughhh this will be a pain to debug

(thankfully it happens very frequently)
FUTURE OLI HERE: This is a real pain in the ass. Entities aren't dying by natural means...
I think im gonna have to proxy the ccall(kill) callback because something
is not right

On second thought: it looks like ents are dying as soon as they enter the screen.
Is this because they are being initialized with 0 hp or something??




Worms are spawning high in the air when jumping
(Not happening with bigworm.lua for some reason)
