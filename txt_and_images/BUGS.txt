Objects that get lifted in the air have friction psys turned on permanently
for some odd reason when they hit the ground




Entities are dying offscreen for an unknown reason
ughhh this will be a pain to debug

(thankfully it happens very frequently)
FUTURE OLI HERE: This is a real pain in the ass. Entities aren't dying by natural means...
I think im gonna have to proxy the ccall(kill) callback because something
is not right

On second thought: it looks like ents are dying as soon as they enter the screen.
Is this because they are being initialized with 0 hp or something??




Worms are spawning high in the air when jumping
(Not happening with bigworm.lua for some reason)
