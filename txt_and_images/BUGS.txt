VERY VERY GOOD INFORMATION FROM T_DUMP:

object disappeared from partition:  
{
  ___mask = 584,
  _cur_portal_period = 0.051206799922511,
  colour = { 0.8, 1, 0.8 },
  draw = {
    h = 16,
    ox = 8,
    oy = 8,
    w = 16
  },
  image = {
    ox = 8,
    oy = 8,
    quad = <userdata 1>
  },
  pos = (+1059.622,+380.543,-30.000)
}

Also, its important to note that `ratioWin`
was called twice before this error



































Entities are dying offscreen for an unknown reason
ughhh this will be a pain to debug

(thankfully it happens very frequently)
FUTURE OLI HERE: This is a real pain in the ass. Entities aren't dying by natural means...
I think im gonna have to proxy the ccall(kill) callback because something
is not right

On second thought: it looks like ents are dying as soon as they enter the screen.
Is this because they are being initialized with 0 hp or something??




Worms are spawning high in the air when jumping
(Not happening with bigworm.lua for some reason)
