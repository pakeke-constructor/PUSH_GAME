Ghost followers arent following their parent.

This is probably because somewhere in the code,
`ent.vel = X` is being done.
So when child ghosts look at the vector they were assigned, it is no longer
being mutated as they expect (which leaves children ghosts following a dead vector)

Only way to salvage this is to make a dumb behaviour tree update function unfortunetely :/














Entities can walk through walls again. NICE!
Do more research in how physics objects can be temporarily suspended whilst keeping
their physical properties (primarily, velocity) intact and cached correctly.
There will probably be a box2d function for it. Ask of the love2d discord if need be
