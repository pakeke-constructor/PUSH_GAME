TODO :::




make (more) wall variations



Make guys headband more thick, also add a tiny bit of shading
(Also try putting black outlines around it, see how that looks)


automatically set ent components to nil upon being removed from systems
(as in, each system is responsible for their respective components!
MoveSys is responsible for removing .pos and .vel, DrawSys is responsible for removing .draw,
BobbingSys is responsible for removing .bobbing, etc etc.)
This will remove a LOT of pressure on GC.
(especially upon ccall("purge") events.)
