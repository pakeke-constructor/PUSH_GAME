TODO :::



We need a better way of constructing new levels.
Doing it directly thru portal interactions is dumb
Maybe rout a `ccall("changeLevel")` callback to ControlSys or something??




make (more) wall variations











Test BuffSystem!
Im pretty sure its all goods but wont hurt ey 



Check ParticleSys for memory leaks!!!
(Best way to do this -> check that no excess ParticleSyses are being
created when not neccessary)




Make guys headband more thick, also add a tiny bit of shading
(Also try putting black outlines around it, see how that looks)


automatically set ent components to nil upon being removed from systems
(as in, each system is responsible for their respective components!
MoveSys is responsible for removing .pos and .vel, DrawSys is responsible for removing .draw,
BobbingSys is responsible for removing .bobbing, etc etc.)
This will remove a LOT of pressure on GC.
(especially upon ccall("purge") events.)
