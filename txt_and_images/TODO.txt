TODO :::



We need a better way of constructing new levels.
Doing it directly thru portal interactions is dumb
Maybe rout a `ccall("changeLevel")` callback to ControlSys or something??




make (more) wall variations





Make KeyPressSys more responsive.
As soon as player pressed keypress button, it will emit a callback






Test BuffSystem!
Im pretty sure its all goods but wont hurt ey 



Make guys headband more thick, also add a tiny bit of shading
(Also try putting black outlines around it, see how that looks)


automatically set ent components to nil upon being removed from systems
(as in, each system is responsible for their respective components!
MoveSys is responsible for removing .pos and .vel, DrawSys is responsible for removing .draw,
BobbingSys is responsible for removing .bobbing, etc etc.)
This will remove a LOT of pressure on GC.
(especially upon ccall("purge") events.)
