Mushrooms drop "Mushroom blocks"
    (or maybe they could drop explosive blocks???)

Mushroom blocks could duplicate when they kill an entity


Explosive blocks


Pine trees drop "Wood blocks"



Blocks become cracked when they kill enemies


HP bar is horizontal (hmm do i like this? idk get more feedback)



Some enemies lose movement ability when pushed (so that enemies get pushed back)
