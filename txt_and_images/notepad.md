# ok:
We need to consistently make it so grass tiles are rendered to the ground.
A world position needs to reflect the same ground tile each time.

IDEA:
Seed the random number gen with the position and roll once to get a random
tile.
This will be deterministically random.


MAKE SURE TO RESET THE SEED AFTER YOU ARE DONE!
