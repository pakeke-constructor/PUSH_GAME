Make it so `pull` can charge up, longer = stronger ??????
(Maybe dont do this as it is less fun)


Chain reaction of blocks that go around and destroy any close blocks.
This discourages creating big groups that make player invincible
DONE: SplatSys :: show jonty! :)


Set a maximum number of blocks for each local area
DONE



Extremely hard boss,
The first few people who kill the boss get to suggest game ideas



Minimap
- we can do this by creating a canvas and rendering the whole map onto it
at the start. Deal with enemy positions seperately by tapping into enemy
targetID partition. Ignore physics blocks on minimap



Explosive walls,
bouncy walls with fixture:setRestitution() :)  


Enemies that destroy blocks in certain radii


Enemies that form a cacoon and constantly emit ccall("pull")
    - 



Trickblock only transforms into enemy when player pulls them



Block letters fall down that tell you the zone
Future oli here: YES!!! Good idea


Explosion and chaos ensue when you die
