Plan:
- We need to keep audience engaged from the very start

- We need to emphasize whats unique- no weapons, only push/pull

- We need to have good music


### SCRIPT 1:
USE THIS MUSIC::: https://youtu.be/UHClzbbpTds

How about just be super genuine, and talk about the game


{

( Wind blowing sound, dark grey background with logo,
player runs in and pulls / pushes logo.
As soon as a the push is emitted, music and script starts. )

<scene_switch switch to peaceful green grass scene>
Hi, I'm Oli, I'm the developer of PushOps.
    <scene_switch: switches to difference green grass scene (COLOURBLIND)>
I'm here to help you decide whether this game is for you or not.

<<MUSIC: first beat change>>

This game is an action roguelike, with procedurely generated levels.
What's unique, is that there are no weapons.

<<MUSIC: second beat change>>

    <scene_switch running away from enemies green grass (NAVYBLIND)>
As a player, you are left barehanded; the only way to defend yourself
is by manipulating the environment
    <scene_switch pull and push, decimating a bunch of enemies
                    (NAVYBLIND, same scene)>
Colliding blocks will deal damage to your foes, provided enough speed.
    <scene_switch show individual enemy getting killed
        (REGULAR BLIND, yellow grass)>



Some enemies are tanky, <show bully (regular, purp grass)>
Some are fast, <show cmallow (DEVILBLIND)>

<<MUSIC: beat change>>

and some manipulate the environment, just like you. <show splat enemy and boxbully (COLOURBLIND active)>

<show mushroom block in use, decimating a crowd of enemies>
There are 4 different kind of blocks too, so make sure you use the right ones

<scene_switch level 7, regular colours, player has totem and blue cross,
            is playing as cyclops>
Alongside this, there are many collectable items you can obtain,
and 6 character skins. <show player pick up item>

<<MUSIC: beat change>>

<scene_switch (REGULAR BLIND, yellow grass) >
So yeah, thats pretty much it. I want to emphasize that this game is a lot smaller than other roguelikes on the market.
But for the price of less than a sandwich, I think it's pretty reasonable.

<scene_switch BULLY_PLAYER (NAVYBLIND, green grass)>
Anyway, take it easy folks, and don't forget to have a good one.

<scene:  remain on screen for a few seconds, with the bully running around
blasting things. >


* SLOWLY FADE TO BLACK *
