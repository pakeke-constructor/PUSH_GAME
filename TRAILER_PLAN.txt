You got a weapons? I like that.
Grenades, guns, ammunition, yeah, this is all good stuff.

And you? You have no gear, what do you do?

a bunch of enemies>

<Music starts playing>

Player goes around fighting, shows different levels, etc
with different colour blind modes on.

Shows text:
<No weapons>
<No armour>
<Only a player,  \
    able to bend physics itself
